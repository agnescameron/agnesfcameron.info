In summer 2018 i taught a 2-hour practical introductory workshop (tagline: *blockchain your mum!*) on blockchains, with an emphasis on ethereum and different consensus models, and a background on the cryptographic primitives that allow these systems to work. The site I made for the class is available [here](https://agnescameron.github.io/how-to-blockchain-almost-anything/index.html), though the resources on it will likely be fairly outdated by now.
